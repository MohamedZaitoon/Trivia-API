## About the Stack

### Backend

The [`./backend`](./backend) directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. My work primarily in [`flaskr/__init__.py`](./backend/flaskr/__init__.py), define endpoints and reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details about installation and API Reference.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The [`./frontend`](./frontend/) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. Which was already implemented.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
